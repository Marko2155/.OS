# Welcome to the .OS GitHub repo!
A (kind of) CLI-based operating system made in .NET.

It has a few commands, and you can post ideas of commands on the issues page and whoever i pick gets their issue closed and added into the program. 
Also don't just stumble across this repo, clone the repo and claim it like it's yours, because if i find any copies, ill check the date it was made, and if it is newer than mine, ill tell the guy that made it to delete it.
I made this because i wanted to make my own OS using Cosmos but it just wouldn't work no matter how hard i tried, so i resorted to .NET, the language that Cosmos is built off of.

# How to use
You can type the commands listed in the wiki OR in the help command.

# To-do list
1: Make a command to let you make programs for .OS
2: thats it.
