# Welcome to the .OS GitHub repo!
A (kind of) CLI-based operating system made in .NET.

It has a few commands, and you can post ideas of commands on the issues page and whoever i pick gets their issue closed and added into the program. 
Also don't just stumble across this repo, clone the repo and claim it like it's yours, because this version is protected by GNU General Public License 3.0.
I made this because i wanted to make my own OS using Cosmos but it just wouldn't work no matter how hard i tried, so i resorted to .NET, the library that Cosmos is built off of.
